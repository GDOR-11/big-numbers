# factorial-calculator
a bunch of big factorials to share on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unexpectedfactorial">r/unexpectedfactorial</a>

in order to use this project, you need to use <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/git?tab=readme-ov-file">microsoft/git</a> instead of git, and then use these commands:
```
scalar clone --no-src https://github.com/GDOR-11/factorial-calculator.git
cd factorial-calculator
git sparse-checkout set src
```
*Be a bit careful though*, installing microsoft/git via homebrew somehow fucked up my neovim setup and I had to re-do it all over again. No idea what happened, but be aware of this possibility.

Downloading the factorials folder is not necessary and is of no use anymore, now the calculator will do everything in the github repository directly
